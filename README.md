Doggowalk is a cutting-edge solution for pet owners and dog walkers alike. With the power of mobile live tracking, our app makes it easy to keep an eye on your furry friend's walks, no matter where they are.

At the heart of our solution is the WebSocket protocol, which allows for real-time communication between our mobile app and our server. By leveraging the power of NodeJS on the server side, we can process and store all of the tracking data generated by our users' walks.

On the front-end, we use React and React Native to create a seamless user experience that's easy to use and provides all the functionality that both pet owners and dog walkers need. With our app, pet owners can view their dog's walk routes, get alerts when their dog has completed a walk, and view the status of their account, while dog walkers can easily manage their schedules, view walking routes, and track their earnings.

In short, Doggowalk is a comprehensive solution that leverages the latest in mobile tracking technology, server-side processing, and front-end development to create a powerful app that's both intuitive and easy to use.

### Non functional requirements

#### Tools and enviroment

1. React.js 
2. React Native / Expo
3. Node.js (Express.js, WS)
4. MongoDB
5. CSS/SCSS

#### Security

SHA256 - All sensitive data is encrypted with a unique token generated using the SHA256 algorithm, which ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
Middleware - Requests to the server require a valid token, and a middleware function is implemented to verify if the user is authorized to make the specific request. This prevents unauthorized access to the system.
Form validation - All requests made to the server are passed through a validation function to ensure that the data is consistent and to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Websockets - The Websockets protocol is used for live tracking of pet walks. Each conversation between clients is assigned a unique key, which restricts access to the data transmitted in that conversation only to the authorized clients. This ensures the privacy and security of the data.

### Functional requirements

User Authentication: 

  - The system should allow users to create an account, and select the role of account (walker,customer).
  
  - The system should allow users to log in using their credentials.

View Available Walkers:

  - The system should provide a list of all available walkers.
  
  - The system should show the walkers' names, picture and description
 
Solicitations:

   -The system should allow users to make a solicitation to a specific walker.
   
  - The solicitation should include the if it's active, accepted, created data, fromUser, toUse
 
   -The websocket protocol needs the solicitation id which is only accessible by granted users
   
  - The walker should be able to accept or refuse the solicitation.
  
 Share Location:
  
 -The system should allow users to share their location with the walker.
 
  - The admin should be able to manage the system settings and configurations
